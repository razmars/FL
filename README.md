## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/timeseer.git
cd timeseer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Basic Forecasting

```typescript
import { TimeSeriesForecaster } from '@/lib/forecaster';

// Load your time series data
const data = await loadData('data.csv');

// Create a forecaster with default ARIMA model
const forecaster = new TimeSeriesForecaster({
  model: 'arima',
  params: { p: 1, d: 1, q: 1 }
});

// Train the model
await forecaster.train(data);

// Generate forecasts for the next 30 time points
const forecast = await forecaster.predict(30);

// Visualize results
forecaster.plot();
```

## üìù API Reference

### TimeSeriesForecaster

The main class for time series forecasting.

```typescript
class TimeSeriesForecaster {
  constructor(options: ForecastOptions);
  async train(data: TimeSeries): Promise<void>;
  async predict(horizon: number): Promise<TimeSeries>;
  evaluate(testData: TimeSeries): Metrics;
  plot(options?: PlotOptions): void;
}
```
